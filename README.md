# ![Rainbow](doc/rainbow-chancery.png)

![logo](doc/small.png) | Dashboard for DeFi options trading highlighting market opportunities to ease strategies decision. With Rainbow, users can scan CEX/DEX markets to fetch available options data. <br><br> This project has been initiated by [Teal.Finance](https://teal.finance/)  during the [Ethereum's EthGlobal Hackathon](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline2021/rainbow), [Solana's Ignition Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/rainbow-ai5p7m) and [Encode Club's Hack DeFi](https://www.encode.club/hack-defi).

## Live Demo

## Motivations

**Rainbow** was inspired by the following trends:

* Crypto-assets and DeFi becoming mainstream,

* Advent of the Internet of Blockchainsâ€™ world  with more cross-chain applications and communications,

* Crypto options trading growing (hopefully) bigger  than the spot market, like in traditional Finance.

The crypto derivatives markets are expected to grow a lot more in the upcoming years.
Specifically, the options markets will see the biggest growth because in Finance, Option market is much bigger
than the underlying spot market. This is lagging in Crypto, when we look at Deribit's volume, the main (centralized) venue for Crypto Options, compared to Perpetuals future.

## Current status

Supported Options exchanges:

* [Deribit](https://www.deribit.com): Centralized exchange. Main venue for crypto Options trading.

* [Opyn(Ethereum)](https://www.opyn.co/):  DeFi options protocol using TheGraph & 0x.

* [PsyOptions(Solana)](https://www.psyoptions.io/): DeFi options protocol build on Serum order books.

* [Zeta(Solana)](https://zeta.markets/): DeFi options protocol build using also Serum order books.

## Requirements

* Go v1.17 or later
* Node v14 or later
* Yarn

[Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(package_manager)) provides a simple way to install these requirements on many Linux distributions:

    snap install go   --classic
    snap install node --classic  # also installs yarn

    # check
    go   version
    yarn versions

On Debian/Ubuntu, the command `sudo apt install golang` may be for an older version.
You can check that with `apt list --all-versions golang`.
If this is your case, you may install Go v1.17 using a different package name:

    sudo apt remove  golang
    sudo apt install golang-1.17

## Clone

    git clone https://github.com/teal-finance/rainbow
    cd rainbow

## CLI

The Rainbow project provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to let users play from their terminal. The command `./cli` retrieves (few minutes) and prints a pretty nice table of all options.

    go build ./cmd/cli && ./cli

## Makefile

See the `make help` [output](Makefile).

### Build

    make build         # Build backend + frontend
    make server        # Build the backend only
    make build-front   # Build the frontend only
    make clean         # Clean all

### Run

The *run* targets do not depend on the above *build* targets.
You do not need to *make build* before *make run*.

    make run           # Run the backend
    make run-front     # Run the frontend in dev mode

### Container

Use the container to reproduce some Prod. behaviors.

    make container-run  # Build and run backend + frontend
    make container-rm   # Stop and remove all

The *container* targets try to use `docker`, then `podman`.

The `container-run` also opens a browser window on <http://localhost:1111/>
and prints the container logs indefinitely.

Use CTRL+C to stop the log printing. This does not stop, the container.
To stop the container simply use `make container-rm`.

The two other *containers* targets are not needed to be invoked manually:

    make container-build  # Build the container image
    make container-stop   # Stop/remove the container

The build parameters can be customized: :slightly_smiling_face:

    make container-run expose=80 port=80 base=/rainbow/

## Manual build/run of the server

### Back-end

The front-end requires the server API.

    go build ./cmd/server && ./server

    # or

    go run ./cmd/server     # same as "make run"

### Front-end

To run the Vue3 front-end in dev mode.
Similar to `make run-front`:

    cd frontend
    yarn
    yarn dev --open

In prod mode, the back-end serves the web static files from `frontend/dist`.
Same as `make frontend/dist`:

    cd frontend
    yarn
    yarn build

Finally open <http://localhost:8090>

## Manual build/run of the container

This Git repo provides a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for a secured and light all-in-one container image: 30 MB.

The image contains the hardened sever executable (with dynamic library)
and the front-end static files.

The container enables by default the CORS, the export ports and a rate limiter.
Some of these features can be customized using environments variables.

The Dockerfile supports Docker-20 and Podman-3. The following build configures CORS with `http://localhost:1111` and backend listening on port 2222:

    podman build --build-arg addr=http://localhost:1111 --build-arg port=2222 -t rainbow .
    podman stop rainbow # if already running in background
    podman run --rm -p 0.0.0.0:1111:2222 -d --name rainbow rainbow
    podman logs --follow rainbow

Open <http://localhost:1111>.

The above can be obtained with:

    make container-run addr=http://localhost:1111 expose=1111 port=2222

See also the comments within the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for more information.

## Server command line flags

Rainbow provides a complete HTTP server,
including a rate limiter, an export port (Prometheus monitoring),
and more. For more details see the underlying project
[Teal.Finance/Garcon](https://github.com/teal-finance/garcon/).

```sh
$ go build ./cmd/server
$ ./server -help
Usage of ./server:
  -addr string
    	Schema and DNS used for doc URL and CORS, has precedence over MAIN_ADDR (default "http://localhost")
  -alert string
    	Mattermost webhook endpoint to activate alerter
  -burst int
    	Max requests during a burst, has precedence over REQ_BURST (default 22)
  -dev
    	Enable the developer mode
  -exp int

}
```

### /v0/options/cp

List the options in Call/Put format: <http://localhost:8090/v0/options/cp>

Rainbow API is currently only used by its web front-end and has been influenced by
the [BFF pattern](https://blog.bitsrc.io/e4fa965128bf) (Backend for Frontend pattern).
This endpoints aims simplifying the front-end processing.

```js
{ "rows":[
    { "asset": "ETH",
      "expiry": "Dec 31 08:00",
      "provider": "Deribit",
      "call": { "bid": {"px": 1805, "size":  24},
                "ask": {"px": 1830, "size": 459}},
      "strike": 4400,
      "put":  { "bid": {"px": 1305, "size":  26},
                "ask": {"px": 1330, "size":  37}}
    },

    { "asset": "ETH",
